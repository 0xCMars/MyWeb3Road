# MyWeb3Road
Record all the resource and code i wrote.

## Before Begin
If you new to blockchain, i recommand you to look at [Dapp-Learning](https://github.com/Dapp-Learning-DAO/Dapp-Learning) which is a great community for newer and help me a lot.

This repository is my web3 learning road map. Having been in contact with web3 for some time, I intend to summarize the resources I have used for some time. At the same time, record the code pattern or function code commonly used in practice, convenient for future reuse.

Finally, the purpose of making these resources open source is to feed back to the community and help more people get in touch with web3 and become web3 contributors more easily.

## Note
In this repository, when writing smart contract, i use solidity + typescript to write my ethereum contract and testcase. Hardhat is my first choice framework to use in project.
